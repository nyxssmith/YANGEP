## Phase 1.1: Sprite Class Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Core Sprite Class
- [x] `Sprite.h` - Header with transform, rendering, and utility methods
- [x] `Sprite.cpp` - Implementation using Cute Framework's sprite API
- [x] Position, scale, rotation, and visibility support
- [x] Proper Cute Framework integration (`cf_make_easy_sprite_from_png`, `cf_draw_sprite`)

### âœ… Sprite Demo Class
- [x] `SpriteDemo.h` - Header for demo functionality
- [x] `SpriteDemo.cpp` - Implementation with interactive demo
- [x] Multiple sprite instances (body, head, demo sprites)
- [x] Keyboard input handling (arrow keys, space bar)
- [x] Animation system (rotation, pulsing scale, bouncing)
- [x] On-screen demo information display

### âœ… Asset Integration
- [x] Uses existing skeleton assets from `tests/assets/skeleton/`
- [x] Loads `skeleton.json` configuration successfully
- [x] Renders `BODY_skeleton.png` and `HEAD_chain_armor_helmet.png` successfully
- [x] Assets properly copied to build directory for runtime access

### âœ… Main Application Integration
- [x] Integrated `SpriteDemo` into `main.cpp`
- [x] Preserved original `main.cpp` functionality
- [x] Added sprite demo alongside existing debug window

### âœ… Build System
- [x] Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include new source files
- [x] Both main executable and test executable compile successfully

### âœ… Runtime Success
- [x] Executable runs without crashes
- [x] Asset loading works correctly from build directory
- [x] Sprite demo displays and responds to input
- [x] All sprite transformations (position, scale, rotation) working

**Current Status**: âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
**Demo Available**: Interactive sprite demo with keyboard controls
**Asset Loading**: âœ… Working correctly with proper file paths

## Phase 1.2: Character Animation System ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

### Planned Features
- [ ] Frame-based animation support
- [ ] Animation state management
- [ ] Transition between animation states
- [ ] Animation timing and speed control

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Extend Sprite class with animation capabilities
- [ ] Create Animation class for managing frame sequences
- [ ] Implement animation state machine
- [ ] Add animation blending and transitions

---

## Phase 1.3: Character Layer System ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

### Planned Features
- [ ] Multi-layer character rendering (body, head, equipment)
- [ ] Layer ordering and depth management
- [ ] Individual layer animation support
- [ ] Equipment attachment system

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create Character class to manage multiple sprites
- [ ] Implement layer management system
- [ ] Add equipment slot system
- [ ] Create layer animation coordination

---

## Testing and Integration âœ… INFRASTRUCTURE READY

### âœ… Unit Testing
- [x] Individual class testing with Google Test
- [x] Mock objects and test fixtures
- [x] Isolated test execution

### âœ… Integration Testing
- [x] Feature-level testing
- [x] Asset loading and rendering tests
- [x] Cross-component interaction tests

### âœ… Test Coverage Goals
- [x] >90% line coverage for core classes
- [x] All public methods tested
- [x] Error handling paths covered

---

## Daily Testing Checklist âœ… READY TO USE

### âœ… Build Verification
- [x] `make build` - Full project compilation
- [x] `make test` - All tests pass
- [x] `make clean` - Clean build verification

### âœ… Runtime Verification
- [x] Main executable runs without crashes
- [x] Sprite demo displays correctly
- [x] Input handling works as expected

---

## Risk Mitigation âœ… ADDRESSED

### âœ… Technical Risks

## TDD Approach (Ready to Use)

### For New Features
1. **Write Tests First**: Define expected behavior in test cases
2. **Implement Feature**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while maintaining test coverage
4. **Repeat**: Continue with next feature

### Current Test Commands
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make test-debug` - Run tests with verbose output
- `make test-coverage` - Generate coverage report
- `make build` - Build main executable with sprite demo
