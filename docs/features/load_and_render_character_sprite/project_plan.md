# Sprite/Character Rendering System - Project Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive sprite and character rendering system for YANGEP that can handle static sprites, animated sprites, and modular character components (head, body, etc.) based on the existing art assets.

## Current Assets Analysis
The project already has character art assets organized as:
- **AnimationsSheets/idle/** - Static/idle character poses
  - `HEAD_chain_armor_helmet.png` (2.7KB)
  - `BODY_skeleton.png` (7.8KB)
- **AnimationsSheets/walkcycle/** - Walking animation frames
  - `BODY_skeleton.png` (23KB) - Larger file suggests multiple animation frames
  - `HEAD_plate_armor_helmet.png` (5.4KB)

## Phase 1: Core Sprite System (Priority: High)

### 1.1 Sprite Class Implementation
- **File**: `src/lib/Sprite.h` and `src/lib/Sprite.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Basic sprite rendering with position, scale, rotation
  - Texture loading and management
  - UV coordinate handling for sprite sheets
  - Z-ordering support
  - Basic transform operations (translate, rotate, scale)

### 1.2 Texture Management
- **File**: `src/lib/TextureManager.h` and `src/lib/TextureManager.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Texture loading and caching
  - Memory management for textures
  - Support for PNG, JPG formats
  - Texture atlasing for performance

### 1.3 Basic Rendering Pipeline
- **Integration**: Extend `main.cpp` and existing rendering system
- **Features**:
  - Sprite batching for performance
  - Basic camera/viewport system
  - Render order management

## Phase 2: Character System (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Character Component System
- **File**: `src/lib/Character.h` and `src/lib/Character.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Modular character assembly (head, body, accessories)
  - Component layering and ordering
  - Character state management (idle, walking, etc.)

### 2.2 Character Renderer
- **File**: `src/lib/CharacterRenderer.h` and `src/lib/CharacterRenderer.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Multi-component rendering
  - Component positioning and alignment
  - Character customization system

## Phase 3: Animation System (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 Animation Framework
- **File**: `src/lib/Animation.h` and `src/lib/Animation.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Frame-based animation system
  - Animation state machine
  - Timeline and keyframe support
  - Animation blending

### 3.2 Sprite Sheet Parser
- **File**: `src/lib/SpriteSheet.h` and `src/lib/SpriteSheet.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic frame detection from sprite sheets
  - Frame metadata (duration, events, etc.)
  - Support for irregular frame layouts

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)

### 4.1 Performance Optimizations
- **Features**:
  - Sprite culling and frustum testing
  - Level-of-detail system
  - GPU instancing for similar sprites

### 4.2 Visual Effects
- **Features**:
  - Particle systems for character effects
  - Shader support for custom effects
  - Post-processing effects

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- **Cute Framework**: For rendering, texture loading, and window management
- **nlohmann/json**: For animation data and character configuration files
- **stb_image**: For image loading (may need to add)

```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Sprite creation and manipulation
- Texture loading and caching
- Animation frame calculation
- Character component assembly

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end character rendering
- Animation playback
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage monitoring

### Manual Testing
- Visual verification of character rendering
- Animation smoothness
- Performance on different hardware
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Basic sprites render correctly on screen
- [ ] Texture loading works without memory leaks
- [ ] Sprite transforms (position, scale, rotation) function properly
- [ ] Performance: 1000+ sprites at 60 FPS

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Character components render in correct layers
- [ ] Character customization system works
- [ ] Character state changes update rendering
- [ ] Performance: 100+ characters at 60 FPS

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] Animation transitions work correctly
- [ ] Sprite sheet parsing is accurate
- [ ] Performance: 50+ animated characters at 60 FPS

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Performance**: Complex character rendering may impact frame rate
- **Memory**: Large texture atlases could consume significant memory
- **Complexity**: Animation system may become overly complex

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance**: Implement sprite batching and culling early
- **Memory**: Add texture compression and streaming
- **Complexity**: Start with simple frame-based animations, add complexity gradually

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks
- **Total**: 9-13 weeks

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up basic Sprite class structure
2. **Week 1**: Implement texture loading and basic sprite rendering
3. **Week 2**: Add sprite transforms and basic camera system
4. **Week 3**: Begin character component system design
5. **Week 4**: Implement character rendering pipeline

## Dependencies on Existing Code

- **DataFile system**: For loading character and animation configurations
- **DebugWindow**: For debugging sprite properties and animation states
- **Utils**: For file system operations and JSON parsing
- **Main loop**: For integration with existing rendering pipeline
